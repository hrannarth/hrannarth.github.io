                                <h3>Maze</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                My role in this assignment was the designer of the maze. I used my previous experience from the other assignments that I did earlier in the course to help with the design of the maze. Designing the maze included nothing new that I did not know before because of my experience with fusion.
                                <br />
                                After we decided to make a maze it was my time to shine as the appointed designer. First of all I stared to make the base of the maze and it's dimensions were 1 x 1 meters.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/Base_maze.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>                                 
                                    After the base had been creaated I mede a new sketch on top of the base and make the outline of the maze, I researched diffrent type of maze but decided to let my creative thinking run its course
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/outline.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/out2.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    Now that the maze is ready I thought to myself that this was too simple so an idea popped into my head that it would add to the artistic feel to the maze to include a tag.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/tag.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/fullm.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    Now that the design waas ready it was time to prepare the file in Vcarve to make the process faster when we get into fablab. First of all I setup up the proper job setup for the milling process.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/setupv.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    For the setting og the drill we had help from the staff in Fablab where they showed us how to set the right feeds and speetrs and also everything related to the geometry of the drill.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/feed.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    Now it was time to prepare the toolpaths for the milling process. Firstly I made a drilling toolpath that made 1 mm hole so that we could place screws on the wood to keep it in place, this was important for safety reasons.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/dr_hole.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    Next up was to create a pocket toolpath that would serve to mill the inside of the maze and also for the tag.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/dr_tag.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/dr_ma.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    Finally it was time to make 2D profle toolpathe that would cut out the outline of the maze. After this was done everything was ready and we milled the maze and we were happy with the outcome.
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/222.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                   
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/m22.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                       <br/>
                                    <img src="images/333.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/> 
                                    
                                </ p>
                                <h3>Mold</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    After the maze was done it was time to design the mold for casting. We decided to make a mold for a sphere to create a ball that could be used to play the maze. I first created the sphere wich would serve as the foundation of the mold. Then I created a box that surrounded the ball and used the combine feature to make a hollow sphere inside the box.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/ball-1.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/ballsphere.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    I created a midplane between the top and bottom of the box so I could use the split feature to cut the box in half
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/plane.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/split.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    After the box had been I hid the top and created a small sphere on the corner of the bottom box and used the rectangular pattern featur to make 3 other spheres tha aligned in symetry on the other corners. Thi was made to make a supprt to the cast when it would be put together. After this was done I used the combine function to cut the top box so the newly made spheres would fitþ
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/pttt.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/fitsphere.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    A hole was needed so we could insert the fluid that would harden to create the sphere. This was easy because of the hole function in Fusion 360.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/holes.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    Next step was to align the top and bottom to be parallel to each other and after that create a box that would then be cut by the top and bottom box.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/bbb.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/lolol.png" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    Now that the design is ready it was time to prepare the toolpaths in fusion 360 (because of Covid we decided to not make them in Vcarce and just use the simulation inside Fusion 360). To start I had to create a setup for the stock inide the manufacture panel in Fusion 360.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/set1.PNG" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/set2.PNG" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/set3.PNG" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                    <br/>
                                    For the toolpath I used 3D adaptive clearing. Inside here I set up the necessary settings so that the milling would work and also edited the flat end mill. See pictures below for the settings.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/p1.PNG" style="border-radius: 5%" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />

                                    <br/>

                                    Now everything is ready for the simulation, here below you can see a video that shows the simulation of the milling process which was made in Fusion 360.
